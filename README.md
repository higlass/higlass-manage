# Manage HiGlass Instances

This utility script helps manage local HiGlass instances

## Prerequisites

To use this utility, you will require:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
-   Python 3

## Installation

`higlass-manage` can be installed using pip

```
pip install higlass-manage
```

## Usage

HiGlass wraps the Docker commands for starting, stopping, listing and populating local higlass instances.

## Tests

To run the tests, first get the test data:

```
./get_test_data.sh
```

And then run the tests:

```
./test.sh
```

### Quickly viewing a dataset

The simplest way to get started is to open and view a dataset. The higlass-manage view command will automatically start a new instance if one isnâ€™t already running, add the given dataset and display it in a browser. Currently, the higlass-manage view command only works with cooler, bigWig, chromsizes and gene-annotation files.

```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/pkerp/public/hic-resolutions.cool
higlass-manage view hic-resolutions.cool
```

### Starting a HiGlass instance

Start a local higlass instance using the default data and temporary directories: `~/hg-data` and `/tmp/higlass-docker`.
All of the data ingested into the instance will be placed into the data directory. Alternate data and temp directory can be specified using `--data-dir` and `--temp-dir` parameters.

```
higlass-manage start
```

If you want to make your instance accessible to the outside world, you need to specify the host URL that it will be available through using the `--site-url` parameter:

```
higlass-manage start --site-url higlass.io
```

These commands will start an instance running on the default port of 8989. An alternate port can be specified using the `--port` parameter. The number of worker processes for the uWSGI application server can be specified with the `--workers` parameter.

#### Using the Redis caching service

To make use of the Redis caching service to improve performance, add the `--use-redis` flag. Redis files will be stored by default in the `~/redis-data` directory. Add the `--redis-dir` parameter to override this default.

```
higlass-manage start ... --use-redis --redis-dir /new/path/to/redis-data
```

#### Setting default client options

To the default options for newly created tracks, use the `--default-track-options` parameter to pass in a JSON file containing either
track-specific or general default track options:

```
$cat default_options.json
{
    "all": {
        "showTooltip": "true"
    }
}

$ ./higlass_manage.py start --default-track-options default_options.json
```

### Ingesting data

Use the `ingest` command to add new data. Generally data requires a `filetype` and a `datatype`.
This can sometimes (i.e. in the case of `cooler` and `bigwig` files) be inferred from the filename:

```
higlass-manage ingest my_data.mcool
```

In other, more ambiguous cases, it needs to be explicitly specified:

```
higlass-manage ingest my_file.bed --filetype bedfile --datatype bedlike --assembly hg19
```

Note that bedfiles don't store chromosome sizes so they need to be passed in using
either the `--assembly` or `--chromsizes-filename` parameters.

#### Custom media directory

By default, `higlass-manage` copies ingested data into a separate directory so
that it can be served by `higlass-server`. If you would like to retain your
data in its original location, use the `--media-dir` option to specify a
separate media directory and ingest files with `--no-upload` and a filepath
relative to the media directory. Example for a file in `data/my_bigwig.bw`:

```
higlass-manage start --no-public-data --media-dir $(pwd)/data
higlass-manage ingest --no-upload my_bigwig.bw
```

### Listing available datasets

```
pete@twok:~/projects/higlass-manage$ higlass-manage list tilesets
VlWKy6ofT6qMFGf-uG_5pQ | beddb | bedlike | GSE93955_CHIP_DMC1_B6_peaks.bed.multires
LAXFhHhASa2zDgJRRS67cw | cooler | matrix | H3K27me3_HiChIP_1.multi.cool
```

### Starting a shell

For debugging purposes it can be useful to run a shell within the Docker container hosting the
higlass instance. This can accomplished using the `shell` command:

```
higlass-manage shell
```

### Getting the error logs

When errors occur they are usually on the higlass-server end. To output the logs use the `logs` command:

```
higlass-manage logs
```

### Stopping a HiGlass instance

To stop a running instance, use the `stop` command:

```
higlass-manage stop
```

### Migrating a HiGlass instance

Migrating a higlass instance between different servers can be done by copying the data-folder, typically `hg-data`, from server of origin to the destination and re-starting higlass:
```bash
# at the destination:
scp -r user@old.host.org:/path/to/hg-data  /new/path/
higlass-manage start --data-dir /new/path/hg-data ...
```
Tilesets ingested at the origin would be available at the destination. However, `viewconf`-s saved at the origin would not work at the destination, because the tilesets would be referred there with original URLs, e.g. `http://old.server.org:PORT`.

This can be fixed by updating `viewconfs` in the database before copying `hg-data`:
```bash
# at the old.host.org:
higlass-manage update-viewconfs --hg-name-old old_hg_name --new-site-url http://new.host.org
```
in this case, higlass instance `old_hg_name` would be used to infer old site URL, port and path to the data folder.

Same can be achieved even without any running higlass instances, but then one has to provide path to the data folder and site's URL and port both "new" and "old":
```bash
# at the old.host.org:
higlass-manage update-viewconfs --old-site-url http://old.host.org --data-dir /old/path/to/data --new-site-url http://new.host.org
```
`update-viewconfs` would save updated database as `/old/path/to/data/db.sqlite3.updated` and keep the original `/old/path/to/data/db.sqlite3` unchanged. Thus, `db.sqlite3.updated` has to be renamed to `db.sqlite3` after migrating to `new.host.org`.


## Development

The following is a list of handy commands when developing HiGlass:

-   **Start locally built docker image**:
    The locally built image must be named `image-default`. Usually built using [higlass-docker](https://github.com/higlass/higlass-docker/).
    ```
    higlass-manage start --version local
    ```
